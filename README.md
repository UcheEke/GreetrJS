# Greetr.js

Based on work on the Udemy course: _"Javascript: Understanding the weird parts"_ with Anthony Alicea

- When given a first name, last name and an optional language parameter, it generates both formal and informal greetings
- Supports both English and Spanish languages initially
- It should be a reusable library/framework
- Has an easy to type 'G$()' structure
- Support jQuery
